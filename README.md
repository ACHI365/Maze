# Maze
Find all possible and optimal ways out of the maze


For this we use recursion and DFS algorithm. We go through all possible nodes and if we can stand on that node, we continue by it, in case we reach the desired destination we just add 1 to the count. After finding all possible ways, we could also find the most optimal solutions by returning first low-int steps to be used.
